# Big Data Analytics
CIS 5450 Big Data Analytics Homework and incoming Project


This repository contains my homework assignments for the Big Data Analytics course. The assignments cover topics such as data wrangling, cleaning and operation using Pandas, SQL, Spark SQL, and machine learning using PySpark and Scikit-learn.

### Data Wrangling and Cleaning (Pandas)
The DataWranglingAndCleaning-pandas directory contains Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate my ability to clean and manipulate data using the Pandas library. Each notebook corresponds to a different assignment and includes the original dataset, data cleaning and transformation steps, and exploratory data analysis.

### SQL
The SQL directory contains SQL scripts that demonstrate my ability to query and manipulate data using SQL. Each script corresponds to a different assignment and includes the original dataset, data cleaning and transformation steps, and SQL queries.

### Spark SQL
The spark-sql directory contains Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate my ability to use Spark SQL to query and manipulate large datasets. Each notebook corresponds to a different assignment and includes the original dataset, data cleaning and transformation steps, and Spark SQL queries.

### Machine Learning (PySpark and Scikit-learn)
The machine-learning directory contains Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate my ability to apply machine learning algorithms using PySpark and Scikit-learn. Each notebook corresponds to a different assignment and includes the original dataset, data cleaning and transformation steps, and machine learning models.


### Acknowledgments
I would like to thank my instructor and classmates for their support and feedback throughout this course.

By following this structure, you can provide a clear overview of your Big Data Analytics homework and make it easy for others to understand and use your work.
