There are many cool frameworks for building deep learning models - PyTorch, Tensorflow, Theano, MxNet. Since you will be working with Big Data in this course, you need a framework that scales well. Almost all of these have a multi-gpu support built in. In this assignment, we will be building neural networks in PyTorch to solve an interesting problem.\n",

        "\n",
        "Convolutional Neural Networks are very similar to Feedforward Neural Networks from the previous section: they are made up of neurons that have learnable weights and biases. Each neuron receives some inputs, performs a dot product and optionally follows it with a non-linearity. The whole network still expresses a single differentiable score function: from the raw image pixels on one end to class scores at the other.\n",
        "\n",
        "So what changes? ConvNet architectures make the explicit assumption that the inputs are images, which allows us to encode certain properties into the architecture. These then make the forward function more efficient to implement and vastly reduce the amount of parameters in the network.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you wanna know more about how CNNs function and see some cool visualizations, we would highly recommend this [page](https://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/)\n",
