There are many cool frameworks for building deep learning models - PyTorch, Tensorflow, Theano, MxNet. Since you will be working with Big Data in this course, you need a framework that scales well. Almost all of these have a multi-gpu support built in. In this assignment, we will be building neural networks in PyTorch to solve an interesting problem.\n",
